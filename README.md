# Logger
# Logger will look over various log files that you add to watch and will determine if there is any bad logs to alert you about.
The hope :
     - Determine if there are IPaddresses attempting to connect to anything that you don't trust and add them to a blocklist. Will eventually attempt to add them to any Router BlockLists
     
     - Determine any failures in the logs and Email/Text you those failures.
